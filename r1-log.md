## Log
 
### R1D1 
Today I finally commited! (pun intended). It's the offitial start date even though all this days I've been doing something. 
Today I learned Class components and Functional components. I still don't have it clear when to use one over the other. But I know now basic structure and key concepts.

### R1D3
Today I continued with the sample project of the ecomerce site. I integrated firebase/auth and studied the basics of structures and methods provided. That was a lot to digest, i'll have to practice it a lot!

### R1D12
Today I started a new course on React. I went over the concepts and structures i already new so I rewatch in FF over the basic lessons I already knew



### R1D13
Same thing as the day before. It was a little bit boring going over the things i already know, except for a few moments I mostly felt that I was loosing my time. 



### R1D14
Today I did a complete small game. With resourses provided by the course I'm taking. I practiced some concepts and structures but it was relativly simple. I felt Good.
